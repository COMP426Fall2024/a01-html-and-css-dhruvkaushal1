            <h2>1. The Labyrinth</h2>
            <p>Icarus and his father, Daedalus, were trapped in the labyrinth built by Daedalus himself for King Minos of Crete. Seeking to escape, Daedalus crafted wings made of feathers and wax.</p>

            <h2>2. The Warning</h2>
            <p>Before their flight, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high, as the sun's heat would melt the wax, nor too low, as the sea's dampness would clog the wings.</p>

            <p>Daedalus and Icarus took flight, escaping the labyrinth. Overcome by the thrill of flying, Icarus ignored his father's warnings and soared higher and higher.</p>

            <p>As Icarus flew too close to the sun, the wax in his wings melted. He fell from the sky into the sea, where he drowned. The sea was later named the Icarian Sea in his memory.</p>
